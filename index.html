        <p id="description">A warm hello from the Luch Responsible this week!</p>

                <p>I am a busy bee lately —two jobs keeping me busy from day to evening— but I couldn't miss the chance to hear what you think about today’s lunch.
                This menu wasn’t just a random pick. I’ve spent time chatting with local shops right here in Sorø, visiting them a few times to craft something I hope you’d enjoy.
                Now, I’d love to hear your thoughts on today’s lunch. Just a few moments of your time could make a big difference. Your feedback can help the next person in charge create an even better lunch experience in the weeks to come. Plus, it lets us choose ingredients more thoughtfully and reduce food waste!
                </p><p>Answers can be anonymous, or feel free to include your name in the end if you'd like. I just want to know what you think.
                </p><p>Curious about my little food adventures? You can check out my very first blog here: [www.]
